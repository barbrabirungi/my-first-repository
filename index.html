        <h1>What is CSS?
        </h1> 
        Like HTML, CSS is <strong>not a programming language.</strong> 
        It's <strong>not a markup language either.</strong> CSS is a style sheet language. 
        CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
        <br>
        <h2 class="underline">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset
        </h2>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" 
        alt="CSS code for red paragraph" 
        width = "300">
        
        <h3>Selector</h3>
        This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled.
        <br>
        <br>
        To style a different element, <em>change the selector.</em> 
        
        <h3>Declaration</h3>
        This is a single rule like color: red;. 
        <br>
        It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
        
        <h3>Properties</h3>
        These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
        
        <h3>Property value</h3>
        To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. 
        <br>
        This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
        
        <h4 id="first-note">Note the other important parts of the syntax:</h4>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>

          <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
            
          <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>  
            
          <li>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:</li>
        </ol>
